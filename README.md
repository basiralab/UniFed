This repository provides the official implementation of our UniFed model accepted to [MLMI-MICCAI-2024](https://sites.google.com/view/mlmi2024/home).

## 🔎 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐅𝐞𝐝?
UniFed is a novel federated learning framework that learns from a mixture of highly heterogeneous tasks by introducing a loss-guided dynamic and sequential model exchange between the server and clients with application to medical image classification. We further remedy the variance in convergence time across clients during our sequential exchange process while being agnostic to task complexity. 

## 🏆 𝐎𝐮𝐫 𝐀𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭
Our experiment has shown the outperformance of UniFed on various medical imaging datasets including OCTMNIST, OrganAMNIST, and TissueMNIST datasets derived from the [MedMNIST](https://medmnist.com/) dataset with classification tasks under both strongly and moderately Non-IID data splits, and showing improvement in communication cost and convergence time over relevant baselines.
